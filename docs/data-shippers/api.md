  <h1>Ingesting via API</h1>
</div>

Axiom has a wide variety of compatibility out-of-the-box with many data shippers because it supports standard APIs such as the [Elasticsearch Bulk Ingest API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html).

If you have a data shipper that supports the Bulk API, then you can configure the shipper to point to Axiom directly. Please see the [Elastic Beats documentation](/data-shippers/elastic-beats) to see some example configuration.

If you are having difficulty configuring your data shippers to work with Axiom, please [get in touch](https://axiom.co/support).
