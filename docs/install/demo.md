  <h1>Axiom Demo</h1>

The quickest way to try out Axiom for yourself is to run our [desktop demo](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-demo) which allows you to run an entire Axiom deployment, including data-shippers, right on your desktop via [Docker](https://docker.com).

By running this demo, you will have an Axiom instance, Postgresql, Minio plus some data-shipper containers. The demo makes it simple to check out many of Axiom's features as well as compatibility with data-shippers and API-based tools.

The Axiom Demo configuration is [open source](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-demo) and we would love your feedback and ideas to make it better!

## Running the Demo

This requires [Docker] and [docker-compose] to be installed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-demo.git
cd axiom-demo
docker-compose up -d
```

Open your browser to [:8080] and log in with these
credentials:

Email: `demo@axiom.co`  
Password: `axiom-d3m0`

For api access (i.e. with the cli) there is a personal access token:
`274dc2a2-5db4-4f8c-92a3-92e33bee92a8`.

See [stopping the stack](#stopping-the-stack) for instructions to tear it down
again.

## CLI

In addition to the frontend you can play around with the
[Axiom CLI].

On macOS/Linux you can use [Homebrew] to install it with:

```sh
brew tap axiomhq/tap
brew install axiom
```

See the [CLI installation](https://github.com/axiomhq/cli) docs for other installation methods.

### Authorize the CLI

Log into your axiom-demo deployment like this:
```sh
echo 274dc2a2-5db4-4f8c-92a3-92e33bee92a8 | axiom auth login --url="http://localhost:8080" --alias="axiom-demo" --token-stdin --token-type personal -f
```

### Using the CLI

Run `axiom --help` to see what commands are supported. Here are a few examples:

```sh
# List all datasets
axiom dataset list

# Get detailed information about a single dataset
axiom dataset info minio-traces

# List dataset stats
axiom dataset stats

# Stream logs into your terminal
axiom stream postgres-logs

# Create a dataset
axiom dataset create --name my-dataset --description "My dataset"

# Ingest into a dataset
axiom ingest my-dataset < file.json
```

## Stopping the Demo

Run `docker-compose stop` to stop the stack, `docker-compose start` to start
it again.

If you want to clean up, run `docker-compose down -v` to remove all containers
and volumes. The docker images will persist on your machine unless you manually
delete them.
